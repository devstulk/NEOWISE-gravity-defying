# NEOWISE: gravity defying 👨‍🚀

NEOWISE: gravity defying is a game where you control an astronaut who needs to jump from planet to planet and avoid falling to accumulate the highest score possible.

## Game Mechanics 🪐

In the game, planets descend across the screen and you must use the controls to move the astronaut from one planet to another. Every second you stay alive adds 1 point to your score. If you fall the game ends.

## Objetivo 🎯

The objective is to survive as long as possible and accumulate the most points, jumping from planet to planet.
